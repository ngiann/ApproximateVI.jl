Pattern Analysis and Applications volume 19, pages 475â€“485, 2015* [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10044-015-0496-9), [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04507.pdf).

**This work in progress, documentation and more functionality will be added soon**


## What is this package about

This package implements variational inference using the re-parametrisation trick.
The work was published in the above publication. 
Of course the method has been popularised by the works ...


## What does the package do

Recommended for problems with relatively few parameters, e.g. 2-20 parameters.

## How to use the package

The package is fairly easy to use. The only function relevant to the user is called `VI`.


## Examples

### Fitting a power law

### Integrating out hyperparameters in a Gaussian process

#### Monitoring "overfitting"
